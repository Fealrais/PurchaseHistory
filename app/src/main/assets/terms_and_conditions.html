            <p>These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
                “PurchaseHistory” mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its related products
                and services (collectively, “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or
                “your”) and this Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering
                into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
                authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall
                refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
                Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and
                Services. By accessing and using the Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have
                read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
                Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
                signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p>

            <h2 id="accounts-and-membership">Accounts and membership</h2>
            <p>If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible for maintaining the security of
                your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other
                actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts
                before you may sign in and start using the Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may
                result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of
                your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
                including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend,
                disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
                provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and
                goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services.
                We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
            <h2 id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
            <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile
                applications, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association,
                sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We
                are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses
                or individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for
                the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review the
                legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link in the
                Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own risk.</p>
            <h2 id="prohibited-uses">Prohibited uses</h2>
            <p>In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using the Mobile
                Application and Services or Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or
                participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international, federal, provincial or state
                regulations, rules, laws, or local ordinances; (d) to infringe upon or violate our intellectual property
                rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (e) to harass, abuse, insult, harm, defame,
                slander, disparage, intimidate, or discriminate based on gender, sexual orientation, religion,
                ethnicity, race, age, national origin, or disability; (f) to submit false or misleading information; (g)
                to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way
                that will affect the functionality or operation of the Mobile Application and Services, third party
                products and services, or the Internet; (h) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape;
                (i) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or (j) to interfere with or circumvent the security features of
                the Mobile Application and Services, third party products and services, or the Internet. We reserve the
                right to terminate your use of the Mobile Application and Services for violating any of the prohibited
                uses.</p>
            <h2 id="severability">Severability</h2>
            <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and
                binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
                to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable.
                If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the
                remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject
                matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and
                effect.</p>
            <h2 id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Agreement or its terms related to the Mobile Application and Services
                at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
                We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact
                information you have provided.</p>
            <p>An updated version of this Agreement will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised
                Agreement unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after
                the effective date of the revised Agreement (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute
                your consent to those changes.</p>
